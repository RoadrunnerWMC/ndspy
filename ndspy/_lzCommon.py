    A configurable function suitable for all LZ-like algorithms.
    Returns the compressed data, the amount of data at the end that
    can be left uncompressed (if the format supports that, such as code
    compression), and the amount of compressed data that that data
    comprises.

    This code is primarily ported from NSMBe.

        over 40 seconds to compress. With this version, all files I've
